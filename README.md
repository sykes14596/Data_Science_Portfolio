# [Project 1: Red Wine Quality: Project Overview](https://github.com/sykes14596/Red_Wine_Quality)

* Created a model that predicts the quality rating of red wine with 85% accuracy.
* Target variable redefined into a binary classification due to unbalanced classes.
* SMOTE technique implemented to create perfectly balanced classes to allow for the solving of the original problem.
* Reduced multicolinearity issues by removing redundant variables.
* Implemented a range of different models, including Logistic Regression and XGBoost classifiers.

## [Project 1: Red Wine Quality: Project Overview](https://github.com/sykes14596/Red_Wine_Quality)

* Created a model that predicts the quality rating of red wine with 85% accuracy.
* Target variable redefined into a binary classification due to unbalanced classes.
* SMOTE technique implemented to create perfectly balanced classes to allow for the solving of the original problem.
* Reduced multicolinearity issues by removing redundant variables.
* Implemented a range of different models, including Logistic Regression and XGBoost classifiers.


## [Project 2: Student Exam Scores: Project Overview](https://github.com/sykes14596/Student_Exam_Results)

For years, students have been using their predicted grades in an effort to monitor their progress throughout their chosen subjects. More recently, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, predicted grades have been used by exam boards, particularly within the UK, as a student's final grade. As a result, the accurate prediction of these grades has grown significantly more important.

* Created models to solve 3 different problems based on the definition of the target variables.
* Identified possible outlying data points and investigated the potential reasons behind these points.
* In the multiclass classification problem, SMOTE technique implmented to create perfectly balanced target classes.
* Range of different model types implemented to gain programming experience using them.
